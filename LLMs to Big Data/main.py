    ### *#About*
    - Group: 05
    - Topic: ML7 - A triple of LLMs: GPT-3, Megatron-Turing NLG, and Gemini
    - Description: Utilize large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, Megatron-Turing NLG, and Gemini in building a robust question-answering system 
    to perform data chat, data analysis and data visualization.
    
    ### *#Usage*
    - Build a question-answering system that can process natural language queries related to data, extract relevant information from datasets, and provide clear answers and insights to users.
    - Use the LLMs for text analysis tasks like sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, and identifying unusual patterns in financial news, social media mentions, and other textual data sources.
    - Combine the insights from the LLMs with visualizations to create interactive dashboards for data-driven decision-making.
